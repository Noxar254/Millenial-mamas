                <!-- Introduction -->
                <div class="story-section">
                    <h2>The Beginning: Dreams and Detours</h2>
                    <p>The legal space is diverse, and lawyers bring their human experiences to fuel their passions. Today, we celebrate Salome Oyosi, an Advocate of the High Court with ten years of post-qualification experience, a Principal Legal Officer at IPOA, and the co-founder of Millennial Mamas.</p>
                    
                    <p>Millennial Mamas is a community-based organization (CBO) that empowers single mothers to overcome stigma and challenges in Kenyan society. The CBO's tagline is simple, yet powerful: <strong>"Mom enough."</strong></p>

                    <p>"Initially, I wanted to be a neurosurgeon after reading Ben Carson's Gifted Hands, but biology happened," Salome recalls with a smile. "I shifted toward law for my undergraduate studies at the Catholic University of Eastern Africa (CUEA)."</p>
                </div>

                <!-- The Turning Point -->
                <div class="story-section">
                    <h2>When Life Takes an Unexpected Turn</h2>
                    <p>After earning her degree and completing pupillage at the Kenya Law Reform Commission, Salome's life took an unexpected direction. In 2014, shortly after her admission to the bar, she became a mother under circumstances that challenged societal expectations.</p>

                    <p>"The life trajectory set out for a typical Kenyan child is to go to school, work hard, get a degree, get a good job, earn big money, then settle down with a spouse. Unfortunately, that 'settling down' puzzle piece didn't fall into place as I had anticipated."</p>

                    <p>Instead of wedding bells, Salome found herself pregnant and alone in her early twenties. "Besides facing the stigma of getting pregnant out of wedlock, I lacked guidance in dealing with rejection from a potential significant other," she reflects.</p>
                </div>

                <!-- The Struggles -->
                <div class="story-section">
                    <h2>Navigating Single Motherhood</h2>
                    <p>The emotional and psychological turmoil was overwhelming. Salome was trapped in a whirlwind of shame, anger, and heartbreak. "The worst part was the loneliness because nobody around me understood the turmoil I was going through."</p>

                    <p>While fortunate to have family support financially, she struggled with other aspects of single parenthood. "There's this engulfing part where you don't know what to do, yet you have nobody to share the burden of raising a child with. I was also grieving the traditional marriage life I had hoped for."</p>

                    <p>Later, career risks and poor decisions led to further challenges. "I was a single mom at 30, living in my parents' house while jobless," she admits candidly.</p>
                </div>

                <!-- The Marriage Mistake -->
                <div class="story-section">
                    <h2>Learning from Missteps</h2>
                    <p>Salome's deep desire for what society considers a 'complete' family influenced some difficult decisions, including a marriage that wasn't meant to be.</p>

                    <p>"In all honesty, Millennial Mamas was born out of ignorance. I wanted to get married, yet I had no clue how to pick a good partner because nobody teaches that. He was an evangelist, and in my ignorance, I believed his faith covered everything, yet we had fundamental differences that meant our dynamic couldn't work."</p>

                    <p>In 2022, Salome made the difficult but necessary decision to leave the marriage, taking her two sons and moving to Ruaka to start over. "All I could think of was 'I wish I had a community.' No one understood me because they couldn't understand why I had left."</p>
                </div>

                <!-- Birth of Millennial Mamas -->
                <div class="story-section">
                    <h2>The Birth of a Movement</h2>
                    <p>One day, while at a friend's house, Salome acted on a lingering thought: "What if we had a community of mums where we could sit, talk, and check on each other? It would be so much easier because even when you feel like breaking in the middle of the night, you can have someone to talk to."</p>

                    <p><strong>That was how Millennial Mamas was born.</strong></p>

                    <p>Starting as a WhatsApp group in August 2022, Millennial Mamas has grown into a registered CBO with 400 members just three years later. The organization now operates across three thematic areas:</p>

                    <ul class="story-list">
                        <li><strong>Mental health and physical wellness</strong> - Weekly conversations, group therapy, and wellness hangouts</li>
                        <li><strong>Entrepreneurship and economic empowerment</strong> - Skills training and wealth creation programs</li>
                        <li><strong>Outreach mentorship programs</strong> - Community service and guidance initiatives</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <!-- Impact Stories -->
                <div class="story-section">
                    <h2>Transforming Lives, Building Futures</h2>
                    <p>"One milestone I celebrate is that through our partnerships, one of our moms got a scholarship and is now a therapist. She pays it forward to the CBO and runs counseling programs at her church."</p>

                    <p>Salome recalls a powerful encounter at a legal training event: "I wore a Millennial Mamas-branded T-shirt, and a fellow female lawyer approached me and broke down in tears. She explained how the WhatsApp group was all the support she had after an acrimonious divorce from an abusive marriage."</p>

                    <p>"Many brilliant women lawyers spend their days championing the rights of others, yet when faced with similar experiences, they have nowhere to turn. Sometimes the unspoken cost of being a 'Learned Friend' is that people expect you to always have things figured out."</p>
                </div>

                <!-- The Vision Forward -->
                <div class="story-section">
                    <h2>Looking Ahead: Building Dreams</h2>
                    <p>Salome's vision extends beyond the current WhatsApp community. She dreams of building a shelter for single mothers in dire situations, providing a physical space for healing while connecting them to jobs and empowerment opportunities.</p>

                    <p>Currently pursuing a PhD in Security Studies at Kenyatta University, her thesis focuses on "Digital Inclusion and the Socio-economic Empowerment of Single Mothers in Nairobi." This research aims to attract like-minded donors to support the organization's goals.</p>

                    <p>"I define myself as an advocate for women, and I'll fight for women with all that I am," Salome declares with conviction.</p>
